Explanation

Understanding the problem
The console error "Error playing whisper audio: Error: HTTP error! status: 404" indicates that the web application attempted to fetch an audio file for the "whisper audio" functionality but the server responded with a 404 Not Found status code. This means the requested audio resource could not be located at the specified URL on the server. The error is occurring within the playWhisperAudio function.

How to verify
Open the Network tab in Chrome DevTools.
Trigger the action that attempts to play the whisper audio.
Look for a network request that corresponds to fetching an audio file (likely an .wav, .mp3, or potentially .m4a file based on search results [1]).
Check the "Status" column for that request. If it shows "404 Not Found", this confirms the issue.
Examine the "URL" column for the failing request to see the exact path the browser was trying to access.
Suggested fix
Investigate why the audio file is not found at the requested URL. Possible reasons include:

The audio file was not uploaded or deployed correctly to the server.
The file path being used in the playWhisperAudio function is incorrect.
The file name is incorrect or has a typo.
The file extension is not supported by the server or the endpoint expecting the audio file [1].
To fix this, ensure the audio file exists on the server at the expected location and that the code is requesting the correct URL.

Summary
A 404 Not Found error occurred when trying to play whisper audio because the requested audio file could not be found on the server. Verify the file's existence on the server and check the URL used to request it in the playWhisperAudio function.
